Secure Annex is a browser extension security platform designed to analyze and monitor Chrome extensions across an organization's endpoints.

- Extension Inventory & Analysis – It scans and catalogs installed Chrome extensions, extracting metadata such as permissions, manifest details, versioning, and developer information.
- Risk Assessment & Policy Enforcement – It evaluates extensions for security risks based on predefined policies, permission analysis, and external threat intelligence sources. Admins can enforce rules to block or allow extensions.
- Real-time Monitoring & Alerts – It continuously monitors for new or modified extensions and alerts security teams when risky or unauthorized extensions are detected.
